## Introduction

**ElixIRCd** is an IRCd (Internet Relay Chat daemon) server implemented in Elixir. It is designed to provide a robust and highly concurrent IRC server environment. Its implementation makes use of the functional nature of Elixir and leverages the built-in concurrency and memory database capabilities of the Erlang VM (BEAM) and OTP (Open Telecom Platform) principles to deliver an efficient and reliable platform for IRC operations.

## Getting Started

Running ElixIRCd with the official Docker image is straightforward. Alternatively, you can connect to the demo server to explore its features or build your own release package from the source code.

### Demo Server

The ElixIRCd demo server is a live instance of the server, allowing you to test and experience its features.

- **Server**: `irc.elixircd.org`
- **Ports**: `6667` (plaintext) and `6697` (SSL/TLS)
- **WebSocket**: `8080` (HTTP) and `8443` (HTTPS)

### Quick Start with Docker

To quickly start the ElixIRCd server using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with the official [ElixIRCd image](https://hub.docker.com/r/faelgabriel/elixircd), run the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  -p 6667:6667 -p 6697:6697 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
  faelgabriel/elixircd
```

#### Remote Commands

```bash
# Connects to the running system via a remote shell
docker exec -it <container_name> ./bin/elixircd remote

# Gracefully stops the running system via a remote command
docker exec -it <container_name> ./bin/elixircd stop
```

#### Configuration

You can configure ElixIRCd by creating a `elixircd.exs` file and mounting it into the Docker container at `/app/config/`.

1. Create a `elixircd.exs` file based on the [default configuration](http://github.com/faelgabriel/elixircd/blob/main/config/elixircd.exs) and customize it as desired.

2. Start the ElixIRCd server with your configuration file by mounting it into the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run \
     -p 6667:6667 -p 6697:6697 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
     -v ./elixircd.exs:/app/config/elixircd.exs \
     faelgabriel/elixircd
   ```

#### SSL Certificates

For development and testing environments, ElixIRCd automatically generates self-signed certificates by default for SSL listeners configured with `keyfile: "data/cert/selfsigned_key.pem"` and `certfile: "data/cert/selfsigned.pem"`.

For production environments, you should configure SSL listeners with a valid certificate and key obtained from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), and place them in your local `data/cert` folder before mounting them into the Docker container at `/app/data/cert/`.

1. Obtain an SSL certificate and key from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

2. Update your `elixircd.exs` configuration file with the paths to the obtained SSL certificate files (e.g., `data/cert/fullchain.pem`, `data/cert/privkey.pem`, and `data/cert/chain.pem`) in the listener configurations, and ensure these files are located in your local `cert/` folder:

   ```elixir
   # ... other configurations
   {:tls, [
      port: 6697,
      transport_options: [
        keyfile: Path.expand("data/cert/privkey.pem"),
        certfile: Path.expand("data/cert/fullchain.pem")
      ]
    ]}
    {:https, [
      port: 8443,
      keyfile: Path.expand("data/cert/privkey.pem"),
      certfile: Path.expand("data/cert/fullchain.pem")
    ]}
   # ... other configurations
   ```

3. Start the ElixIRCd server with your configuration and certificate files by mounting the `cert/` folder into the Docker container at `/app/data/cert/`:

   ```bash
   docker run \
     -p 6667:6667 -p 6697:6697 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
     -v ./elixircd.exs:/app/config/elixircd.exs \
     -v ./cert/:/app/data/cert/ \
     faelgabriel/elixircd
   ```

#### Listener Configurations

ElixIRCd uses [ThousandIsland](https://hexdocs.pm/thousand_island/ThousandIsland.html) for TCP and TLS listeners, and [Bandit](https://hexdocs.pm/bandit/Bandit.html) for HTTP (WS) and HTTPS (WSS) listeners.

- **TCP and TLS Listeners** (`:tcp` and `:tls`): These use [ThousandIsland](https://hexdocs.pm/thousand_island/ThousandIsland.html) as the underlying server implementation. You can configure additional options as documented in the [ThousandIsland documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/thousand_island/ThousandIsland.html#t:options/0).

  ```elixir
  {:tcp, [
    port: 6667,
    # Additional ThousandIsland options
    num_acceptors: 100,
    num_connections: 10_000,
  ]}
  ```

- **HTTP and HTTPS Listeners** (`:http` and `:https`): These use [Bandit](https://hexdocs.pm/bandit/Bandit.html) as the underlying server implementation. You can configure additional options as documented in the [Bandit documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/bandit/Bandit.html#t:options/0).

  ```elixir
  {:http, [
    port: 8080,
    # Additional Bandit options
    thousand_island_options: [
      num_acceptors: 100,
      num_connections: 10_000,
    ]
  ]}
  ```

#### MOTD (Message of the Day)

You can set the Message of the Day by creating a `motd.txt` file mounting it into the Docker container at `/app/config/`.

1. Create a `motd.txt` file with your desired message of the day.

2. Start the ElixIRCd server with your MOTD file by mounting it into the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run \
     -p 6667:6667 -p 6697:6697 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
     # ... other volume mounts
     -v ./motd.txt:/app/config/motd.txt \
     faelgabriel/elixircd
   ```

#### Channel Configurations

Channel configurations are done through the `channel` key in the `elixircd.exs` configuration file.

```elixir
# ... other configurations
:channel, [
  # ... channel configurations
]
```

#### User Configurations

User configurations are done through the `user` key in the `elixircd.exs` configuration file.

```elixir
# ... other configurations
:user, [
  # ... user configurations
]
```

### Start from the Source Code

To build your own ElixIRCd release from the source code and run the server, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment by following the instructions in the [Development - Setting Up Your Environment](#setting-up-your-environment) section.

2. Build a release package by running the following command, replacing `0.0.1` with the desired version:

   ```bash
   APP_VERSION=0.0.1 MIX_ENV=prod mix release
   ```

3. Start the ElixIRCd server by running the generated release:

   ```bash
   _build/prod/rel/elixircd/bin/elixircd start
   ```

## Development

ElixIRCd is written in Elixir, so you'll need to have Elixir and Erlang installed on your machine. We recommend using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to easily install and manage Elixir and Erlang versions. Additionally, you need to have Git installed to clone the repository.

### Setting Up Your Environment

#### Clone the Git Repository

If you don't have `Git` installed, follow the GitHub's [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) guide.

Clone the ElixIRCd Git repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faelgabriel/elixircd.git
cd elixircd
```

#### Install Elixir and Erlang with asdf

If you don't have `asdf` installed, follow the instructions on the [asdf website](https://asdf-vm.com/).

Add the necessary plugins and install the required versions:

```bash
# Add the Erlang plugin to asdf
asdf plugin-add erlang
# Add the Elixir plugin to asdf
asdf plugin-add elixir
# Install the versions specified in the .tool-versions file
asdf install
```

#### Install Dependencies

To install the project dependencies, run:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

### Code Quality Assurance

Ensuring code quality assurance is essential for the stability of the project. You can run all the necessary checks, including compilation warnings, code formatting, linting, security analysis, dependency audits, documentation checks, and static analysis, with a single command:

```bash
mix check
```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite with code coverage, use:

```bash
mix test --cover
```

### Building and Running the Docker Image Locally

To build and run the ElixIRCd Docker image locally, use:

```bash
docker build -t elixircd .
docker run -p 6667:6667 -p 6697:6697 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 elixircd
```

### Running Server in Interactive Mode

To start ElixIRCd in interactive mode, which is useful for development and debugging, run:

```bash
iex -S mix
```

This command starts an interactive Elixir shell (IEx) with your application running, allowing you to interact with your server in real-time.
