# Security Policy for ElixIRCd

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of ElixIRCd is a top priority, but as our project is still evolving, we're currently refining our formal security response strategy. We deeply appreciate your support and understanding in keeping ElixIRCd secure.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in ElixIRCd, we encourage you to share your concerns with us through the following provisional method:

- **Please submit a general inquiry via our project's GitHub Issues, labeling it as a "Security Concern".** Do this without providing specific details about the vulnerability to avoid public disclosure. We will contact you to discuss the matter securely.

We're committed to working with the community to verify and respond to security issues thoughtfully and promptly.

## Supported Versions

Given the ongoing development of ElixIRCd, we're currently focusing security efforts on the latest version available on our main branch. We recommend always using the most recent version to ensure you have the latest security updates.

## Policy

- **Acknowledgment:** We aim to acknowledge any security concerns raised as quickly as possible.
- **Investigation and Response:** While we strive to address issues as quickly as possible, the timeline for resolving vulnerabilities may vary based on their complexity and the availability of resources. We will keep you informed of our progress and any updates.

Your contributions and patience are invaluable to us, and we thank you for helping us improve the security and reliability of ElixIRCd.
